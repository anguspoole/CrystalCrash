## About

I made this game in university with Unity. You control a rhino, and your objective is simply to smash as many crystals as you can. The crystals come onto the screen from all 4 cardinal directions, and each direction has a different colour:

* From Above: Purple
* From Below: Blue
* From Left: Red
* From Right: Green

If you collide with a crystal of a different colour from your own, then you will die and the game ends. There's a highscore system as well where you can enter 3 initials and have it recorded on your computer.

## Instructions

* WASD: move
* I: change colour to purple
* J: change colour to red
* K: change colour to blue
* L: change colour to green

Recommended to play at 1024 x 768 resolution, in windowed mode.
